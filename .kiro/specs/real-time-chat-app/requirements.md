# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for a real-time chat application built with Flutter that demonstrates modern messaging features using Firebase Firestore for instant communication. The application will showcase BLoC state management and clean architecture principles for scalable development, featuring user authentication, room management, real-time messaging, and message status indicators.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to authenticate with email and password, so that I can securely access the chat application and maintain my identity across sessions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user enters valid email and password THEN the system SHALL authenticate the user and grant access to the application
2. WHEN a user enters invalid credentials THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate error message and deny access
3. WHEN a user wants to create a new account THEN the system SHALL provide a registration form with email and password fields
4. WHEN a user successfully registers THEN the system SHALL create a user profile in Firestore and authenticate them
5. WHEN a user profile is created THEN the system SHALL store user information (email, display name, creation timestamp) in Firestore
6. WHEN authentication state changes THEN the system SHALL update the UI accordingly using BLoC state management

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to manage chat rooms, so that I can organize conversations and participate in different discussion topics.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user wants to create a new chat room THEN the system SHALL provide a form to enter room name and description
2. WHEN a user creates a room THEN the system SHALL store the room information in Firestore with creator details and timestamp
3. WHEN a user views the room list THEN the system SHALL display all available chat rooms with their names and participant counts
4. WHEN a user selects a room THEN the system SHALL allow them to join and navigate to the chat interface
5. WHEN a user joins a room THEN the system SHALL add them to the room's participant list in Firestore
6. WHEN room data changes THEN the system SHALL update the UI in real-time using Firestore listeners

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want to send and receive messages instantly, so that I can have real-time conversations with other participants.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user types a message and sends it THEN the system SHALL store the message in Firestore with sender ID, timestamp, and room ID
2. WHEN a message is sent THEN the system SHALL display it immediately in the chat interface with sender indication
3. WHEN other users send messages THEN the system SHALL receive and display them instantly using Firestore real-time listeners
4. WHEN displaying messages THEN the system SHALL show them in chat bubbles with clear sender/receiver visual distinction
5. WHEN messages are loaded THEN the system SHALL display them in chronological order with timestamps
6. WHEN the chat interface loads THEN the system SHALL automatically scroll to the most recent message

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see message status indicators, so that I know when my messages have been delivered and read by recipients.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a message is successfully stored in Firestore THEN the system SHALL mark it as "delivered" with a visual indicator
2. WHEN a recipient views a message THEN the system SHALL update the message status to "read" in Firestore
3. WHEN message status changes THEN the system SHALL update the visual indicators in real-time for the sender
4. WHEN displaying messages THEN the system SHALL show appropriate status icons (sent, delivered, read) next to each message
5. WHEN multiple recipients are in a room THEN the system SHALL track read status per recipient
6. WHEN a user opens a chat room THEN the system SHALL mark all visible messages as read for that user

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the application to follow clean architecture principles with BLoC state management, so that the codebase is maintainable, testable, and scalable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing features THEN the system SHALL separate concerns into Presentation, Domain, and Data layers
2. WHEN managing state THEN the system SHALL use BLoC pattern with proper event-state flow
3. WHEN accessing external services THEN the system SHALL implement repository pattern with dependency injection
4. WHEN handling business logic THEN the system SHALL implement use cases in the Domain layer
5. WHEN managing dependencies THEN the system SHALL use a dependency injection container for loose coupling
6. WHEN implementing data sources THEN the system SHALL abstract Firebase operations behind repository interfaces
7. WHEN handling errors THEN the system SHALL implement proper error handling with custom failure types
8. WHEN testing THEN the system SHALL support unit testing for business logic and widget testing for UI components
